        <p class="poem">From the dead. With pallbearers who are half as young</p>
        <p class="poem">as their faces suggest and twice the oxen they should be.</p>
        <p class="poem">Without a daddy at all, or with a daddy in prison, or at home,</p>
        <p class="poem">or in a different home. With a mama. With a grandmama</p>
        <p class="poem">if mama ain’t around, maybe even if she is. In a house, or not.</p>
        <p class="poem">In the hood. In the suburbs if you’re smart or not afraid of white</p>
        <p class="poem">fear or even if you are. Taking risks. Scratching lottery tickets.</p>
        <p class="poem">Making big bets. On a basketball court. Inside a courtroom.</p>
        <p class="poem"><i>Poorly</i> in the ever-pathological court of opinion. On faith. Like</p>
        <p class="poem">a prayer from the belly of a whale. In church on Sunday morning,</p>
        <p class="poem">on Monday, Tuesday, and every other. Before school and after.</p>
        <p class="poem">In a school you hope doesn’t fail. In a school of thought named</p>
        <p class="poem">for Frederick Douglass. Old school or not at all. With hip-hop or</p>
        <p class="poem">without. At least with a little Curtis Mayfield, some Motown,</p>
        <p class="poem">sounds by Sam Cooke. Eating that good down-home cooking.</p>
        <p class="poem">Putting some wood to their behind. With a switch. With a belt</p>
        <p class="poem">to keep their pants high. Not high all the time. On all-time highs</p>
        <p class="poem">at all times until they learn not to feel and think so lowly of</p>
        <p class="poem">their aims. To be six feet tall and not under. With a little elbow</p>
        <p class="poem">grease and some duct tape. Sweating bullets. On a short leash.</p>
        <p class="poem">Away from the big boys on the block. Away from the boys in blue.</p>
        <p class="poem">Without the frill of innocence. From the dead, again. Like a flag.</p>
