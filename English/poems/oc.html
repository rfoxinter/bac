        <p class="poem">went on the days we saved enough money.</p>
        <p class="poem">Everyone was in a good mood, even Ullu—</p>
        <p class="poem">our uncle who never smiled or took off his coat</p>
        <br class="poem"/>
        <p class="poem">&amp; dyed his hair black every two weeks</p>
        <p class="poem">so we couldn’t tell how old he was. We marched</p>
        <p class="poem">single file towards the gigantic red lettering</p>
        <p class="poem">across the grueling parking lot to announce</p>
        <br class="poem"/>
        <p class="poem">our arrival. We, children carrying our rectangle</p>
        <p class="poem">backpacks brimming with homework, calculators</p>
        <p class="poem">&amp; Lisa Frank trapper keepers, for we knew this was a day</p>
        <p class="poem">without escape, spread out across all the booths</p>
        <br class="poem"/>
        <p class="poem">possible while our family ate &amp; ate &amp; snuck</p>
        <p class="poem">food into the Tupperware they smuggled in</p>
        <p class="poem">&amp; no matter how we begged &amp; whined</p>
        <p class="poem">or the waitresses yelled or threatened to charge</p>
        <br class="poem"/>
        <p class="poem">us more money we weren’t leaving</p>
        <p class="poem">until my greedy ass family had their fill.</p>

        <p class="poem">we could get dessert &amp; eat as much of it</p>
        <br class="poem"/>
        <p class="poem">as we wanted before our actual meal.</p>
        <p class="poem">The only place we didn’t have to eat all</p>
        <p class="poem">the meat on our plates or else we were accused</p>
        <p class="poem">of being wasteful, told our husbands</p>
        <br class="poem"/>
        <p class="poem">would have as many pimples as rice we left behind.</p>
        <p class="poem">Here, our family reveled in the American</p>
        <p class="poem">way of waste, manifest destinied our way</p>
        <p class="poem">through the mac &amp; cheese, &amp; green bean</p>
        <br class="poem"/>
        <p class="poem">casseroles, mythical foods we had only</p>
        <p class="poem">heard about on TV where American</p>
        <p class="poem">children rolled their eyes in disgust. Here</p>
        <p class="poem">we learned how to say <i>I too have had meat loaf</i></p>
        <br class="poem"/>
        <p class="poem"><i>&amp; hate it</i>, evidence we could bring back</p>
        <p class="poem">to the lunch table as we guessed</p>
        <p class="poem">what the other kids ate as they scoffed</p>
        <p class="poem">at our biriyani. Here, the adults told</p>
        <br class="poem"/>
        <p class="poem">us if we didn’t like the strawberry shortcake</p>
        <p class="poem">we could eat the ice cream or jello we could</p>
        <p class="poem">get a whole plate just to try a bite</p>
        <p class="poem">to turn up our noses &amp; that was fine.</p>
        <br class="poem"/>
        <p class="poem">Here we loosened the drawstrings</p>
