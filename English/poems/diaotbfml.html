        <p class="poem">By way of my mother, the deacon with the slick gray hair and money</p>
        <p class="poem">clip in his pocket can claim a percentage of my body like tithe rights.</p>
        <p class="poem">And on this Sunday, as with every other Sunday, he is a slender</p>
        <p class="poem">ebony panel in the fence of faith, one man in the company of men</p>
        <p class="poem">standing shoulder to shoulder in suits, tapping their toes, clapping</p>
        <p class="poem">their hands, putting muscle to work in the making of praise music.</p>
        <p class="poem">We Baptists call this <i>devotion</i>, my working definition of which</p>
        <p class="poem">is <i>faithfulness to the light</i>. To the extent that God is as white</p>
        <p class="poem">as the clouds of heaven, this theory holds. To the extent these</p>
        <p class="poem">particular men are dark, I must consider other possibilities:</p>
        <p class="poem">that God remade himself in my image so that we could be closer</p>
        <p class="poem">or that devotion means <i>the commitment of black men to stand</i></p>
        <p class="poem"><i>with one another</i>, form a barricade of soldiers against anything</p>
        <p class="poem">as necessary, the Lord being the force holding them fast in line.</p>
        <p class="poem">It isn’t always easy for me to see these explanations as separate:</p>
        <p class="poem">any film, any photograph of Martin Luther King Jr. leading a march,</p>
        <p class="poem">with his position centered in a line of bodies covering the entire width</p>
        <p class="poem">of the frame — if I take a wide view of that scene, I see the Lord at</p>
        <p class="poem">work. If I zoom in, on a single person or the breach between two, I see</p>
        <p class="poem">no trace of the Lord at all, a hint that He can’t exist in small spaces.</p>
        <p class="poem">                                                                  And what’s more, consider this:</p>
        <p class="poem">say Chicago PD pulls a long line of youths into the precinct for</p>
        <p class="poem">photographs — all of them dark, all of them wearing the same colors — </p>
        <p class="poem">and stands them shoulder to shoulder. Zoom in: nothing. Zoom out:</p>
        <p class="poem">the Lord? Why not? There’s clearly commitment there, devotion.</p>
        <p class="poem">They’re all definitely soldiers, on the battlefield for something:</p>
        <p class="poem">maybe it’s white, maybe it’s green, maybe it’s a colorless</p>
        <p class="poem">feeling. I’ve got no good answers, only darkness. I’m still trying</p>
        <p class="poem">to decipher if it means anything that Dr. King lived in Vice</p>
        <p class="poem">Lords territory when he spent ’66 in Chicago, that the words</p>
        <p class="poem">“vice” and “Lord” are affiliates, homeboys, next-door neighbors.</p>
        <p class="poem">I think about their coming up together in the mind of a boy</p>
        <p class="poem">living on that side of town, a percentage of his body, perhaps,</p>
        <p class="poem">claimed as a tax; I can’t shake this feeling that when he throws his</p>
        <p class="poem">muscles into praise music, when sound leaves his precious mouth,</p>
        <p class="poem">people scatter. I can’t help but believe our songs, to one another,</p>
        <p class="poem">would be familiar, church family:</p>
        <br class="poem"/>
        <p class="poem">                                                      <i>I am on the battlefield for my Lord</i></p>

        <p class="poem">                           <i>and I promised Him that I</i></p>
        <p class="poem">                                          <i>would serve Him till I die</i></p>
