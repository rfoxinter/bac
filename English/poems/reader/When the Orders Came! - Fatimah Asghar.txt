<p class="poem">they shipped us to the sanctuary camps</p>
<p class="poem">&amp; we forgot our other countries.</p>
<br class="poem"/>
<p class="poem">like good schoolchildren we sung</p>
<p class="poem">the anthem loud, so loud</p>
<p class="poem">until we could hear nothing else.</p>
<br class="poem"/>
<p class="poem">not the birds delighting</p>
<p class="poem">over their young, or the dogs’ snarl</p>
<p class="poem">at our feet, or him on the news</p>
<br class="poem"/>
<p class="poem">hourly, growling. this is the cost</p>
<p class="poem">of looking the other way</p>
<p class="poem">when they come for us:</p>
<br class="poem"/>
<p class="poem">I build safety inside you</p>
<p class="poem">&amp; wake in cuffs.</p>
<p class="poem">I’m all mouth. every morning</p>

<br class="poem"/>
<p class="poem">but a camp? sanctuary</p>
<p class="poem">but another grave? I am an architect.</p>
<p class="poem">I permission everything</p>

<p class="poem">into something new.</p>
<p class="poem">I build &amp; build</p>
<p class="poem">&amp; someone takes it away.</p>
