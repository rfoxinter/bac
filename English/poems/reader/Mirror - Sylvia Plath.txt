<p class="poem">I am silver and exact. I have no preconceptions.</p>
<p class="poem">Whatever I see I swallow immediately</p>
<p class="poem">Just as it is, unmisted by love or dislike.</p>
<p class="poem">I am not cruel, only truthful,</p>
<p class="poem">The eye of a little god, four-cornered.</p>
<p class="poem">Most of the time I meditate on the opposite wall.</p>
<p class="poem">It is pink, with speckles. I have looked at it so long</p>
<p class="poem">I think it is part of my heart. But it flickers.</p>
<p class="poem">Faces and darkness separate us over and over.</p>
<br class="poem"/>
<p class="poem">Now I am a lake. A woman bends over me,</p>
<p class="poem">Searching my reaches for what she really is.</p>
<p class="poem">Then she turns to those liars, the candles or the moon.</p>
<p class="poem">I see her back, and reflect it faithfully.</p>
<p class="poem">She rewards me with tears and an agitation of hands.</p>
<p class="poem">I am important to her. She comes and goes.</p>
<p class="poem">Each morning it is her face that replaces the darkness.</p>
<p class="poem">In me she has drowned a young girl, and in me an old woman</p>
<p class="poem">Rises toward her day after day, like a terrible fish.</p>
