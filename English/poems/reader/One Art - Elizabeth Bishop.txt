<p class="poem">The art of losing isn’t hard to master;</p>
<p class="poem">so many things seem filled with the intent</p>
<p class="poem">to be lost that their loss is no disaster.</p>
<br class="poem"/>
<p class="poem">Lose something every day. Accept the fluster</p>
<p class="poem">of lost door keys, the hour badly spent.</p>
<p class="poem">The art of losing isn’t hard to master.</p>
<br class="poem"/>
<p class="poem">Then practice losing farther, losing faster:</p>
<p class="poem">places, and names, and where it was you meant</p>
<p class="poem">to travel. None of these will bring disaster.</p>
<br class="poem"/>
<p class="poem">I lost my mother’s watch. And look! my last, or</p>
<p class="poem">next-to-last, of three loved houses went.</p>
<p class="poem">The art of losing isn’t hard to master.</p>
<br class="poem"/>
<p class="poem">I lost two cities, lovely ones. And, vaster,</p>
<p class="poem">some realms I owned, two rivers, a continent.</p>
<p class="poem">I miss them, but it wasn’t a disaster.</p>
<br class="poem"/>
<p class="poem">—Even losing you (the joking voice, a gesture</p>
<p class="poem">I love) I shan’t have lied. It’s evident</p>
<p class="poem">the art of losing’s not too hard to master</p>
<p class="poem">though it may look like (<i>Write</i> it!) like disaster.</p>
