<p class="poem">I’m “wife”—I’ve finished that—</p>
<p class="poem">That other state—</p>
<p class="poem">I’m Czar—I’m “Woman” now—</p>
<p class="poem">It’s safer so—</p>
<br class="poem"/>
<p class="poem">How odd the Girl’s life looks</p>
<p class="poem">Behind this soft Eclipse—</p>
<p class="poem">I think that Earth feels so</p>
<p class="poem">To folks in Heaven—now—</p>
<br class="poem"/>
<p class="poem">This being comfort—then</p>
<p class="poem">That other kind—was pain—</p>
<p class="poem">But why compare?</p>
<p class="poem">I’m “Wife”! Stop there!</p>
