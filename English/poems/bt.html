        <p class="poem">When I was laughed at for my clumsy English, I touched my throat.</p>
        <p class="poem">Which said <i>ear</i> when my ear said year and <i>year</i> after year</p>
        <p class="poem">I pronounced a new thing wrong and other throats laughed.</p>
        <p class="poem"><i>Elevator</i>. <i>Library</i>. Vibrating bells in their mouths.</p>
        </br class="poem">
        <p class="poem">How to say <i>azalea</i>. How to say <i>forsythia</i>.</p>
        <p class="poem">Say instead golden bells. Say <i>I’m in ESL</i>. In French class</p>
        <p class="poem">a boy whose last name is Kring called me <i>belle</i>.</p>
        <p class="poem">Called me by my Korean name, pronouncing it wrong.</p>
        <p class="poem">Called it loudly, called attention to my alien.</p>
        </br class="poem">
        <p class="poem">(I touched the globe moving in my throat, a hemisphere sinking.)</p>
        </br class="poem">
        <p class="poem">Called me across the field lined with golden bells.</p>
        <p class="poem">I wanted to run and be loved at the same time. By Kring.</p>
        <p class="poem">As in ring of people. <i>Where are you going? We’re laughing with you</i>.</p>
        <p class="poem">The bell in our throat that rings with laughter is called uvula. From <i>uva</i>: grape.</p>
        <p class="poem">A theory: special to our species, this grape-bell has to do with speech.</p>
        <p class="poem">Which separates us from animals. Kring looked at me and said</p>
        <p class="poem"><i>Just curious, do you eat dogs?</i> and I wanted to end my small life.</p>
        <p class="poem">Be reborn a golden retriever of North America.</p>
        <p class="poem">Lie on a field lined with golden bells, loved.</p>
        </br class="poem">
        <p class="poem">Today, in a country where dogs are more cherished</p>
        <p class="poem">than a foreign child, an Oregon Senate candidate says no</p>
        <p class="poem">to refugees. Says, years ago, Vietnamese refugees ate dogs,</p>
        <p class="poem"><i>harvested</i> other people’s pets. <i>Harvest</i> as in <i>harvest</i> grapes.</p>
        <p class="poem"><i>Harvest</i> as in <i>harvest</i> a field of golden rice. As do people</p>
        <p class="poem">from rice countries. As in people-eat-dog worlds.</p>

        <p class="poem">Years ago, 1923 Japan, the phrase <i>jūgoen gojissen</i> was used</p>
        <p class="poem">to set apart Koreans: say <i>15 yen 50 sen</i>. The colonized who used the chaos</p>
        <p class="poem">of the Kanto Earthquake to poison waters, set fire: a cruelty special to our species.</p>
        <p class="poem">A cruelty special to our species — how to say <i>jūgo</i>, how to say <i>gojit</i>,</p>
        <p class="poem">how <i>jūgo</i> sounds like die in Korean, how <i>gojit</i> sounds like <i>lie</i> —</p>
        <p class="poem"><i>lie</i>, <i>lie</i>, <i>library</i>, <i>azalea</i>, <i>library</i>.</p>
