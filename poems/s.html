        <p class="poem">September rain falls on the house.</p>
        <p class="poem">In the failing light, the old grandmother</p>
        <p class="poem">sits in the kitchen with the child</p>
        <p class="poem">beside the Little Marvel Stove,</p>
        <p class="poem">reading the jokes from the almanac,</p>
        <p class="poem">laughing and talking to hide her tears.</p>
        </br class="poem">
        <p class="poem">She thinks that her equinoctial tears</p>
        <p class="poem">and the rain that beats on the roof of the house</p>
        <p class="poem">were both foretold by the almanac,</p>
        <p class="poem">but only known to a grandmother.</p>
        <p class="poem">The iron kettle sings on the stove.</p>
        <p class="poem">She cuts some bread and says to the child,</p>
        </br class="poem">
        <p class="poem">It’s time for tea now; but the child</p>
        <p class="poem">is watching the teakettle’s small hard tears</p>
        <p class="poem">dance like mad on the hot black stove,</p>
        <p class="poem">the way the rain must dance on the house.</p>
        <p class="poem">Tidying up, the old grandmother</p>
        <p class="poem">hangs up the clever almanac</p>
        </br class="poem">
        <p class="poem">on its string. Birdlike, the almanac</p>
        <p class="poem">hovers half open above the child,</p>
        <p class="poem">hovers above the old grandmother</p>
        <p class="poem">and her teacup full of dark brown tears.</p>
        <p class="poem">She shivers and says she thinks the house</p>
        <p class="poem">feels chilly, and puts more wood in the stove.</p>
        </br class="poem">
        <p class="poem">It was to be, says the Marvel Stove.</p>
        <p class="poem">I know what I know, says the almanac.</p>
        <p class="poem">With crayons the child draws a rigid house</p>
        <p class="poem">and a winding pathway. Then the child</p>
        <p class="poem">puts in a man with buttons like tears</p>
        <p class="poem">and shows it proudly to the grandmother.</p>
        </br class="poem">
        <p class="poem">But secretly, while the grandmother</p>
        <p class="poem">busies herself about the stove,</p>
        <p class="poem">the little moons fall down like tears</p>
        <p class="poem">from between the pages of the almanac</p>
        <p class="poem">into the flower bed the child</p>
        <p class="poem">has carefully placed in the front of the house.</p>
        </br class="poem">
        <p class="poem">Time to plant tears, says the almanac.</p>
        <p class="poem">The grandmother sings to the marvelous stove</p>
        <p class="poem">and the child draws another inscrutable house.</p>
